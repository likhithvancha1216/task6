## Deliverables  
- `report.md` — analysis, findings, and recommendations  
- `commands.md` — (if any command-line or tool usage summary)  
- `Password_Strength_Comparison_1.png` — bar chart visualization of crack times  
- `Password_Strength_Comparison_2.png` — alternate bar chart visualization of crack times

## How to Use This Repo  

1. View the images (`Password_Strength_Comparison_1.png` and `Password_Strength_Comparison_2.png`) to see the password crack time comparisons.  
2. Read `report.md` for analysis and conclusions on what makes passwords strong.  
3. Refer to `commands.md` (if used) for any tools or commands you ran.
