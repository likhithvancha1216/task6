## Approach  
- Tested sample passwords (`password123`, `P@ssword2025!`, `M!cr0$oft_SeCur1ty#2025`) on:  
  - [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)  
  - [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)

## Results from Tools  
- **Weak (`password123`)** → Crack time: < 1 second  
- **Medium (`P@ssword2025!`)** → Crack time: ~8 hours  
- **Strong (`M!cr0$oft_SeCur1ty#2025`)** → Crack time: > 5 trillion years

## Notes

- Results are documented in `report.md` with visualizations.  
- Example passwords used only for demonstration — not for real accounts.
